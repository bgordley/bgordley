## Game Development :video_game:	
One of my favorite hobbies is developing video games. [See my library of obscure games](https://beardedfists.itch.io/).

I enjoy being able to transfer my software engineering skills into the creative space and aim to one day release a fully completed game on Steam.

While I have worked with Unity and Unreal Engine in the past, I have found that Godot is my favorite engine overall. I am very proficient with Godot and I am able to bring my ideas to life in a matter of minutes.

## Family :family_man_woman_boy:
I love my family and every minute I am able to spend with them. I work hard to provide for my wife and son, always focused on balancing work and home. :grin:.
