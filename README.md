## Game Development :video_game:	
One of my favorite hobbies is developing video games. [See my library of jam games](https://beardedfists.itch.io/).

I participate in game jam competitions, enjoying being able to transfer my software engineering skills into the creative space to solve a much different set of technical problems.

While I have worked with **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** in the past, I have found that **Godot** is my favorite engine overall. I am very proficient with Godot and I am able to bring my ideas to life in a matter of minutes.

## Family :family_man_woman_boy:
