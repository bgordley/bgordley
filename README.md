# About Me
Hi there, my name is **Bryan Gordley**. Allow me to share a little bit about myself, what I do, and some things that bring great joy to my life.

## Software Development :computer:
I currently work as a software engineer building cutting-edge healthcare software for a fantastic small business in the Pacific Northwest :evergreen_tree:.

When I find the time I enjoy prototyping interesting ideas for new services and applications in various languages. [Check out my github page.](https://github.com/bgordley) 

## Game Development :video_game:	
One of my absolute favorite hobbies is developing small video games. [See my library of obscure games](https://beardedfists.itch.io/).

I enjoy being able to transfer my software development skills into the creative space. My art on the other hand could use some work.

## Family :family_man_woman_boy:
It's a cliche and also the honest truth. I love my family and every minute I am able to spend with them.

I hope that some day my son will become an even better developer than I am :grin:.
